# Simple Endless Runner Using Phaser 3

## Description

2D side scroller scene with a runner and scrolling background using the Phaser 3 game engine.

Mostly a learning project after doing the [Making your first Phaser 3 game](https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1) tutorial. Still getting the hang of spritesheets and the physics attributes.
